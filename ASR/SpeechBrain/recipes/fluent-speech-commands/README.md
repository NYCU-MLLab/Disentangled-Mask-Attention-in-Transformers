# SLU recipes for Fluent Speech Commands
This folder contains recipes for spoken language understanding (SLU) with [Fluent Speech Commands](fluent.ai/research/fluent-speech-commands/).

### Tokenizer recipe
(You don't need to run this because the other recipes download a tokenizer, but you can run this if you want to train a new tokenizer for Fluent Speech Commands.)

Run this to train the tokenizer:

```
cd Tokenizer
python train.py hparams/tokenizer_bpe51.yaml
```

### Direct recipe
The "direct" recipe maps the input speech to directly to semantics using a seq2seq model.
The encoder is pre-trained using the LibriSpeech seq2seq recipe.

```
cd direct
python train.py hparams/train.yaml
```

# PreTrained Model + Easy-Inference
You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/slu-direct-fluent-speech-commands-librispeech-asr).


# Training Time
About 15 minutes for each epoch with a TESLA V100.
