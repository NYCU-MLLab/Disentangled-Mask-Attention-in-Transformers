# MetricGAN+ Recipe for Enhancement

This recipe implements MetricGAN+ recipe for enhancement as described in the paper
[MetricGAN+: An Improved Version of MetricGAN for Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03538)

Use the `download_vctk` function in `voicebank_prepare.py` to download the dataset
and resample it to 16000 Hz. To run an experiment, execute the following command in
the current folder:

```bash
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/data_folder
```
