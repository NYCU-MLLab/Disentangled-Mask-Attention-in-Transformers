# Language Model with LibriSpeech
This folder contains recipes for training language models for the LibriSpeech Dataset.
It supports both an RNN-based LM and a Transformer-based LM. 
The scripts rely on the HuggingFace dataset, which manages data reading and loading from
large text corpora. 

You can download LibriSpeech at http://www.openslr.org/12

# Extra Dependency:
Make sure you have the HuggingFace dataset installed. If not, type:
pip install datasets

# How to run:
python train.py hparams/RNNLM.yaml
python train.py hparams/transformer.yaml

# Training time
Training a LM takes a lot of time. In our case, it take 3/4 weeks on 4 TESLA V100. Use the pre-trained model to avoid training it from scratch
