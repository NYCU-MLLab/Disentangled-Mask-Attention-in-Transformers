# AISHELL-1 ASR with Transformers.
This folder contains recipes for tokenization and speech recognition with [AISHELL-1](https://www.openslr.org/33/), a 150-hour Chinese ASR dataset.

### How to run
1- Train a tokenizer. The tokenizer takes in input the training transcripts and determines the subword units that will be used for both acoustic and language model training.

```
cd ../../Tokenizer
python train.py hparams/train_transformer_tokenizer_bpe5000.yaml --data_folder=/localscratch/aishell/
```
If not present in the specified data_folder, the dataset will be automatically downloaded there.
This step is not mandatory. We will use the official tokenizer downloaded from the web if you do not 
specify a different tokenizer in the speech recognition recipe. 

2- Train the speech recognizer
```
python train.py hparams/train_ASR_transformer.yaml --data_folder=/localscratch/aishell/
```
