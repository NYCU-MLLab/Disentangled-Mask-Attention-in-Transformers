# Recipes for ASR with AISHELL-1
This folder contains recipes for tokenization and speech recognition with [AISHELL-1](https://www.openslr.org/33/), a 150-hour Chinese ASR dataset.

### Base recipe
The recipe uses an attention-based CRDNN sequence-to-sequence model with an auxiliary CTC loss.
To train a full recipe:

1- Train a tokenizer. The tokenizer takes in input the training transcripts and determines the subword units that will be used for both acoustic and language model training.

```
cd ../../Tokenizer
python train.py hparams/tokenizer_bpe5000.yaml --data_folder=/localscratch/aishell/
```
If not present in the specified data_folder, the dataset will be automatically downloaded there.
This step is not mandatory. We will use the official tokenizer downloaded from the web if you do not 
specify a different tokenizer in the speech recognition recipe. 

2- Train the speech recognizer
```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder=/localscratch/aishell/
```

# Performance summary
Results are reported in terms of Character Error Rate (CER). It is not clear from published results whether spaces are kept or removed when computing CER; we therefore report results for both settings. (This can be controlled using `python train.py hparams/train.yaml --remove_spaces={True,False}`.)

[Test Character Error Rate (CER).]
| System | Test CER |
|----------------- | ------|
| Base (remove spaces) | 7.76 |
| Base (keep spaces) | 7.51 |

# Training Time
It takes about 1h 30 minutes on a NVIDIA V100 (32GB).
